 > ManyToOne - OneToMany relationship:
   - At scale avoid using the bidirectional implementation, where OneToMany creates a list mapped by the other sides ManyToOne relation.
     It's a neat implementation when working with relatively small data sets, otherwise it becomes very resource intensive!
   - Setter on the mappedBy side can't exist, rather and Adder or "get list > add" system with dependency injection.
     
 > OneToOne - OneToOne
   - Setter on the mappedBy side needs a dependency injection.
