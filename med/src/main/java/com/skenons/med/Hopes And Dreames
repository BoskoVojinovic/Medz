MODEL:
	> ManyToOne - OneToMany relationship:
		- At scale avoid using the bidirectional implementation, where OneToMany creates a list mapped by the other sides ManyToOne relation.
     	It's a neat implementation when working with relatively small data sets, otherwise it becomes very resource intensive!
		- Setter on the mappedBy side can't exist, rather and Adder or "get list > add" system with dependency injection.
     
	> OneToOne - OneToOne
		- Setter on the mappedBy side needs a dependency injection.

FRONT:
	> Profile redirect
		- SecurityConfig blocks access to /profile for non auth requests. Requests that pass thourgh security will be sorted by the ProfileController
		based on the users role.
	> Send data to front
		- You can send data to the frontEnd pages by attaching a Model object and adding attributes to it.
		You can retrieve those attributes via ThymeLeaf using th:each, th:text ect... methods.
